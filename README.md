## What is hexadecimal math?
Hexadecimal math (aka. base 16, hex) is used mainly for representing large numbers in a smaller manner.
### Hex versus base 16
**Decimal:** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 </br>
**Hex:**     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A  B  C  D  E  F 

In other words, base is 0-15 and hex is 0-9 -> 10 = A, 11 = B, all the way to 15, which is F.
